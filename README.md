# Autonomous-GPS-Guided-Rover-Bot-project

> A group project submitted under the guidance of **TA Pallav Sir**, this autonomous rover bot leverages GPS and magnetometer-based navigation to move toward a target location without manual intervention.

## üîç About the Project

This project is a GPS-based autonomous rover bot designed to navigate towards predefined GPS coordinates using real-time location tracking and orientation correction. The system is built around an **ESP32 microcontroller**, **NEO-6M GPS module**, **magnetometer**, and **DC motors** controlled via a motor driver. 

The rover calculates its heading and adjusts its path continuously based on the difference between the target bearing and current orientation. Future enhancements include obstacle avoidance and RTK-level GPS accuracy.

##  Objectives

- Navigate autonomously to a set of GPS coordinates.
- Determine direction using a magnetometer for heading calculation.
- Correct trajectory in real-time using motor control logic.
- Tackle hardware integration and signal accuracy challenges in embedded systems.

##  Working Principle

1. **Initialization**: Set up GPS, magnetometer, motors, and communication protocols (UART, I2C).
2. **Position Acquisition**: NEO-6M receives GPS signals and ESP32 parses the NMEA data.
3. **Bearing Calculation**: The ESP32 calculates the required bearing to the destination using trigonometric functions.
4. **Heading Detection**: The magnetometer determines the current heading of the bot.
5. **Decision-Making**: Based on heading error, the ESP32 commands the bot to go straight, turn left, or turn right.
6. **Navigation Loop**: Continuous updates to GPS and heading allow dynamic corrections until destination is reached.
7. **Error Handling**: In case of unreliable GPS, fallback measures like hardcoded coordinates or halting are used.
